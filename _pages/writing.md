## _Friends on the Internet_

My pandemic project! Iâ€™m working on a series of essays, delivered weekly via Substack, recapping each episode of the first season of Catfish: The TV Show. In this newsletter, I explore themes of loneliness, conflict, and connection in the digital age - themes that, after the events of 2020, interest me all the more. Digressions include Barbra Streisand movies, pop punk music, true crime, and more. Subscribe [here](https://friendsontheinternet.substack.com/).
