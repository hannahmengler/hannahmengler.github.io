Consumer insights analyst by day, writer and pop culture obsessive by night. Audience development at the [Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group](http://knopfdoubleday.com/). Passionate about finding new ways to deliver stories into the hands of their perfect reader. Working to make publishing a more diverse and equitable industry. New York City is my forever home.

Here, you can find all the campaigns I've worked on ([Title Marketing](https://hannahmengler.github.io/titles/)), some projects I'm especially excited about ([Special Projects](https://hannahmengler.github.io/projects/)), and my favorite books.
