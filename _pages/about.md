Hi, I'm Hannah â€” New Yorker, marketing and consumer insights professional, writer and pop culture obsessive. 

In my five years in the publishing industry, I've handled the US hardcover marketing campaigns for 30 books (including two New York Times bestsellers!). In 2021, I moved to a new role as marketing manager overseeing consumer insights. In this role, I work to provide essential research to support data-driven decisions at every stage of the publishing process, from messaging and content strategy to effective ad targeting. 

I've been writing professionally since 2015, and my words have appeared on Book Riot, Forbes.com, and the American Writers Museum blog. 

You can find out more about my current, just-for-fun writing projects [here](https://hannahmengler.github.io/writing/), as well as more information about my [work](https://hannahmengler.github.io/marketing/), my [resume](https://hannahmengler.github.io/resume/), and [how to get in touch](https://hannahmengler.github.io/contact/). Thanks for stopping by!
